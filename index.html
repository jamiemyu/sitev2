                    <p><span class="first-character section1">H</span>ey there! My name is Jamie Yu, and I'm a twenty-one year-old from Boston, Massachusetts. I am a rising senior at Case Western Reserve University, located in Cleveland, Ohio. Ever since I was young, I knew that I loved to create. While I can't remember every detail of my childhood, one thing I do remember is watching my dad tinker around with old computer parts. My fascination for building and designing continued to grow as I realized that in high school, the classes that enjoyed the most involved problem-solving and creative thinking. For that reason, I decided to follow my father's footsteps and pursue an engineering degree in college, entering as a Biomedical Engineering student in 2014.</p>

                    <p><span class="first-character section2">R</span>ight now, I'm in the final year of my undergraduate studies at Case Western Reserve University. The one course that I now realize I enjoyed the most in my freshman year - but didn't at the time - was Introduction to Computer Programming. This was my first experience with programming, having no idea what it even meant to "program" before college. This course was taught in MATLAB, and unlike many others, I found the concept of writing out logic to solve problems extremely interesting. For that reason, I decided to continue on with programming education, by taking Introduction to Programming in Java, where I got to dive into more challenging programming concepts and work on larger projects.</p>

                    <p class="margin-top-10">After discovering that computer programming might be one of my passions, I couldn't let myself go through college without learning more. Its now my final year of college, and I'm completing two degrees in Biomedical Engineering and Electrical Engineering. Some of the courses I look forward to taking include Linear Algebra, Algorithms and Biomedical Image Processing and Analysis. I also just completed an internship at Verily Life Sciences (formerly Google Life Sciences). Its pretty cool to finally understand that I have a passion for programming.</p>

                    <p><span class="first-character section3">I</span>n the summer of 2016, I flew across the country to the Bay Area. I got accepted into the Engineering Practicum Internship at Google, located at their headquarters in Mountain View, California. Little did I know that I would be returning the following summer in 2017, to the same city, but this time to work at Verily! I spent 12 weeks of both summers living in a small neighborhood of San Francisco called Noe Valley, commuting to work on the Google bus. I'm not sure what it is, but something about San Francisco keeps me coming back for more.</p>

                    <p class="margin-top-10">I don't like to think of my time at Google and Verily as just internships or jobs, but more as new experiences. Throughout my time at these companies, I learned invaluable lessons on how to write code for a large group of end-users, how to communicate with people older than me, and how to think critically. Most importantly, I learned that I was really lucky to find something that I already loved doing at age 21. I spent both summers waking up at 5am to get to work, and leaving work no earlier than 7pm. Yet to me, these hours spent every day were the best hours that I could ever ask for.</p>
