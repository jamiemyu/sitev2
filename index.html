                    <p><span class="first-character section1">H</span>ey there! My name is Jamie Yu, and I'm a twenty-one year-old from Boston, Massachusetts. I am a rising junior in college, at Case Western Reserve University, located in Cleveland, Ohio. Ever since I was young, I knew that I loved to create. While I can't remember every detail of my childhood, one thing I do remember is watching my dad tinker around with old computer parts. My fascination for building and designing continued to grow as I realized that in high school, the classes that enjoyed the most involved problem-solving and creative thinking. For that reason, I decided to follow my father's footsteps and pursue an engineering degree in college, entering as a Biomedical Engineering student in 2014.</p>

                    <p><span class="first-character section2">F</span>reshman year I took many introductory-level courses, including Calculus, Physics, and Materials. The one course that I now realize I enjoyed the most - but didn't at the time - was Introduction to Computer Programming. This was my first experience with programming, having no idea what it even meant to "program" before arriving at college. This course was taught in MATLAB, and unlike many others, I found the concept of writing out logic to solve problems extremely interesting. For that reason, I decided to continue on with programming education, by taking Introduction to Programming in Java, where I got to dive into more challenging programming concepts, work on larger projects, and learn about testing.</p>

                    <p class="margin-top-10">After taking two computer science courses, however, I still didn't realize how much I enjoyed programming. After discovering that computer programming might be one of my passions, I couldn't let myself go through college without learning more about data structures, algorithms, and computer logic, organization, and design. Now I am entering my third year of college, and I am now a declared double-major in Biomedical Engineering and Electrical Engineering, with concentrations in Computing and Analysis, and Biomedical Applications. I have also just completed an internship at Google in the twelve-week Engineering Practicum. I have discovered that I have a passion for programming.</p>

                    <p><span class="first-character section3">I</span>n the summer of 2016, I flew across the country to the Bay Area. I got accepted into the Engineering Practicum Internship at Google, located at their headquarters in Mountain View, California. I spent the next 12 weeks living in a small neighborhood of San Francisco called Noe Valley, commuting to work on the Google bus. I remember multiple times throughout the summer, thinking to myself: is this real life?</p>
                    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                    <p class="margin-top-10">I don't like to think of my time as Google as an internship or a job, but more of an overall new experience. Throughout my entire experience at Google, I learned invaluable lessons on how to write code for a large group of end-users, how to communicate with people older than me, and how to think critically. Most importantly, I learned that I was really lucky to find something that I already loved doing at age 20. I spent the entire summer waking up at 5am to get to work, and leaving work no earlier than 5pm. Yet to me, those ten hours spent every day were the best ten hours that I could ever ask for.</p>
