                      <p><span class="first-character section1">S</span>enior year as a BME/EE major at CWRU means two semesters worth of senior projects. These projects are meant to culminate the knowledge and engineering skills we've mastered in our undergraduate careers, and put them to use. For my senior project, I have decided to focus on monitoring of Alzheimer's Disease through sleep-state classification. The purpose of this project is to create an automated sleep-stage classification device with applications in both clinical and ambulatory settings. In doing so, this product brings to the market a novel approach to recording and classifying disordered sleep in both in-hospital and at-home patients.</p>
                      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p><br>
                      <p>Such a device has high priority level in the healthcare industry, as it provides useful information regarding the progression of sleep-affected diseases, allowing clinicians to better assess and reevaluate (if necessary) the diagnosis when moving forward. The overarching goal of this project is to develop both the hardware and software necessary to create a standalone EEG signal recording device that produces classified sleep data in an easy-to-read manner.</p>
                      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p><br>
                      <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is used in clinical testing to evaluate the electrical activity of the brain. Alzheimerâ€™s disease, autism, and epilepsy, are just a few named brain diseases and disorders that alter brain activity and consequently produce EEG abnormalities. More commonly, sleep patterns are observed through EEG recordings. By observing characteristics of an EEG signal, such as power and frequency, one can classify the five distinct stages of sleep and identify if sleep is abnormal.Typically, EEG recordings must be conducted over several hours, and sleep-stage classification is based off of human interpretation of pages of EEG waveform activity. Inevitably, this may produce human error and more generally, requires significant time.</p>

                      <p><span class="first-character section1">W</span>hile interning at Verily Life Sciences, I worked on a <a href="https://verily.com/projects/interventions/retinal-imaging/">project</a> involving early detection of diabetic eye diseases, such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). Diseases such as these are difficult to monitor, and are usually detected in later stages, when blindness is pretty likely. With the aid of computer technology, disease detection can be improved significantly.</p>
                      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p><br>
                      <p>During my twelve weeks at Verily, I developed a new web application that demonstrates the models developed at Verily to detect DR and DME using machine learning. With expansion of the project comes new requirements for the models, and therefore a whole new set of information to be shared with clinicians and others viewing the disease detection information. Additionally, each new onboarding partner requests specific needs in the output of the model, and the information displayed on the web application varies significantly. The complexity of my project came from this idea of customization. My end-goal was to create a flexible and easily customizable client application that met the needs of various end-users.</p>
                      <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p><br>
                      <p>I worked with several main Google-internal technologies and frameworks, programmed in JavaScript, and added HTML/CSS to style the page. By the end of the summer, I had written over 16,000 lines of code, submitted over 50 code reviews, and completed a working version of the application. While I was sad to leave Verily, I was also proud of the work I left behind. With my web application, the team can now demonstrate their APIs in a user-friendly and visually aesthetic format. With further development and project continuation, the work I completed this summer will improve the way in which diabetic eye diseases are detected and monitored.</p>
